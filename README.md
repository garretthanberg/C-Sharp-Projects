# C# Projects
This repository features a collection of projects developed using C#, .NET Framework, and .NET Core, showcasing my skills in application development using these technologies.

Black Jack Console Game:
Enjoy a console-based version of the timeless game of Black Jack with this project implemented using C# and the .NET Framework. This game offers an interactive gaming experience where players can place bets, make strategic decisions, and challenge the dealer in an exciting virtual casino setting. The project demonstrates my ability to create console-based applications using C# and the .NET Framework.

Car Insurance 2.0:
Experience a simulated car insurance website with this MVC web application. Built using C# and .NET Core, this project allows users to input their policy information, and based on the implemented business logic, it calculates a quote. The application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for obtaining insurance quotes. Additionally, an admin page is implemented, enabling company staff to view all issued quotes for efficient management. The Car Insurance 2.0 project demonstrates my proficiency in developing web applications using C#, .NET Core, and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

These projects serve as examples of my application development skills using C#, .NET Framework, and .NET Core. Feel free to explore and utilize them as references or starting points for your own projects in these technologies.
