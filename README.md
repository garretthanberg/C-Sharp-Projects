# C# Projects
This a repository of some small projects I have made using C#, .NET Framework, and .NET Core.
  
Black Jack Console Game:
Play the classic game of Black Jack on this console version created with C# and the .NET Framework.

Car Insurance 2.0:
This MVC web app mimics a car insurance website. Upon the user's input with their policy infortmation it calculates a quote based on business logic. I have also implemented a admin page that allows the companies staff to view all of the quotes issued.
